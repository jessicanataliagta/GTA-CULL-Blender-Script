Create a cube in the shape of the area that you want to affect.  
ATTENTION: GTA Cull does not support rotations, so NEVER, rotate the cube. You can just scale it for the sides.  

How to use:  
Drag and drop the .py to the script tab then run.  
Select your cube, go to the "object properties tab" and select the flags that you want to use, click on "generate cull zone".  
Go to "window" "toggle window console", the cull zone lines will be there.  

This script does not support (yet):  
Import/Export the .ipl    
GTA III VC IV (Only GTA SA is supported at moment.)
